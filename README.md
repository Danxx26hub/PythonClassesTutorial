* What is OOP?
    * A way to organize your code, also known as paradigm.
    * Develop large Software or even small making them easier.
    * You can associate real world objects and replationships in your code
    * NOT ALL Programs should be written in OOP or need to be 
    * Python allows you to use OOP or not use OOP or mix both paradigm.

* Objects:
    * a "Thing" in your program
    * example a PERSON
        * Can Walk, Talk or Run
        * Can have a named
        * You can define your own classes

* Classes are used to create objects:
    * you can create many, unique objects from a single class
    * Classes define the type.
    * When you create and object from a class that is know as "instantianting".
